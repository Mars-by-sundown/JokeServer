<h3> ColorServer Logic: </h3>

<pre>
Server Main loop

 Create a server socket listening at port X

 Loop while loopvar is true
    Block while waiting for a connection to X
    Spawn a new worker thread and pass it the connection.

 Exit


ColorWorker thread

  Process the data coming over the connection.
  Optional: If the data is shutdown, then change loopvar to false.
  Close the connection
  Terminate the thread.

--------------------------------------------
</pre>

<h3> JokeServer Logic: </h3>

Of course there are <i> many </i> ways that you could achieve the same
thing. This is just an example, food for thought.

<pre> 
Joke Server Main loop

 Create a Mode thread and send it off,
   asynchronously, to get MODE instructions.

 Create a server socket listening at port X

 Loop while loopvar is true
    Block while waiting for a connection to X
    Spawn a new worker thread and pass it the connection.

 Exit


Mode Server Main Loop

 Create a server socket listening at port M

 Loop while Server still running.
   Block while waiting for a connection to M
   Spawn a new ModeWorker thread and pass it the connection.
  

ModeWorker thread

  Process the data coming over the connection.
  
  If the data is mode change, then change the MODE (e.g., from joke mode to proverb mode)
  Optional: If the data is shutdown then change the loopvar for main to false
  Close the connection
  Terminate the thread.


JokeWorker thread

  Process the data coming over the connection, according to the mode.

  Close the connection
  Terminate the thread.
